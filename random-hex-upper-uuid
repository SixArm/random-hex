# Generate a random UUID-like string with hexadecimal upper case
#
# Usage:
#
#     random-hex-upper-uuid
#
# Example:
#
#     $ random-hex-upper-uuid
#     902DBA9D-D7BA-F8F6-7038-472D75D232E7
#
# The UUID format is defined in RFC 4122, ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005,
# and related standards.
#
# This script generates all random numbers and formats the string;
# this script does not attempt to use the standard, nor set any bits,
# such as for version encoding and/or variant encoding.
#
# This script uses the commands `hexdump` and `/dev/urandom`
# to generate secure random numbers and format them.
#
# A UUID may be represented either in uppercase or lowercase.
# Lowercase is common in Unix; uppercase is common on Windows.
#
# If your system has the `uuidgen` tool, consider using it
# instead because it's faster; use the `-r` random flag.
#
# Example uuidgen on Linux:
#
#     $ uuidgen -r
